## [Unreleased]

## [23/02/2025] - Eureka
- Successfully executed the `random_forest.py` script.
- Installed necessary dependencies: `transformers`, `openpyxl`, `tensorflow_decision_forests`, and `accelerate`.
- Trained a Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests.
- Simulated trading using the DeepSeek model.
- Created `training.py` to launch all model training processes at once.
- Analyzed `processor_Binance.py`, `your_bot_script.py`, `4_backtest.py`, and `function_finance_metrics.py` for code organization and architecture improvements.
- Implemented a new modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  - Created configuration module for centralized settings
  - Implemented logging and notification utilities
  - Defined base interfaces for models, processors, strategies, and execution
  - Created metrics utilities for performance analysis
  - Set up proper package structure with initialization files
  - Added a main entry point with command-line argument parsing
- Renamed project to ELVIS (Enhanced Leveraged Virtual Investment System) and added ASCII art to the main entry point
- Set ELVIS to non-production mode by default for safety:
  - Added PRODUCTION_MODE flag to configuration
  - Added safety checks to prevent accidental live trading
  - Updated run script with warnings for live mode
  - Added clear non-production warnings to documentation
- Migrated existing code to the new structure:
  - Implemented BinanceProcessor for data processing
  - Implemented TechnicalStrategy for trading signals
  - Implemented BinanceExecutor for order execution
  - Implemented RandomForestModel for predictions
- Added unit tests for components:
  - Created test suite for BinanceProcessor
  - Created test suite for TechnicalStrategy
  - Created test suite for BinanceExecutor
  - Created test suite for RandomForestModel
  - Created test suite for RiskManager
  - Added integration tests for the entire system
- Implemented additional trading strategies:
  - Added Mean Reversion strategy using Bollinger Bands and RSI
  - Added Trend Following strategy using Moving Averages and ADX
- Added more model types:
  - Implemented Neural Network model using LSTM and Dense layers
  - Implemented Ensemble model combining multiple models
- Added performance monitoring and reporting:
  - Implemented trade tracking and metrics calculation
  - Added visualization of equity curve, daily returns, and win/loss distribution
  - Created HTML performance reports
