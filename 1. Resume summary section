As Head of DevOps and Infrastructure at FlowBank, I led key initiatives leveraging over 20 years of IT and project management expertise. I built a high-performing DevOps team and oversaw the development of Switzerland's first **Wi-Fi 7** campus. My expertise in **VMware**, **ITIL V3**, **Six Sigma**, and **Agile** methodologies ensured resilient infrastructure and efficient operations.

A key success was implementing **AWS cloud services** and **Kubernetes microservices**, transforming FlowBank’s infrastructure to be more scalable and reliable. Additionally, I introduced **Teleport** for secure infrastructure access and **ServiceNow** for automated **CMDB**, streamlining operations and enhancing IT service management.

I also spearheaded cost-saving initiatives by transitioning from **Cisco** to **Huawei** for networking and migrating databases from **MS SQL** to **PostgreSQL**, significantly reducing costs while maintaining system performance.

Despite these successes, FlowBank faced financial difficulties, leading **FINMA** to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in June 2024 due to regulatory non-compliance. My efforts in modernizing infrastructure and automating processes were crucial achievements during this challenging period.

Now, I am eager to apply my skills in AWS, automation, and infrastructure optimization to new opportunities that drive growth and efficiency.

At the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), I served as the Team Leader of the SysAdmin Team, leading key infrastructure projects and managing team operations. My role included hiring, training, and distributing work among the team, ensuring effective collaboration and project delivery.

A major accomplishment was upgrading the Lausanne BiomedIT node (https://www.biomedit.ch/home/biomed-it-infrastructure.html), enhancing its capacity to support bioinformatics research. I also led the transition of the campus and data center network from HP to Huawei, which improved network performance, scalability, and reduced costs.

I managed the decommissioning of the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, previously used for decoding DNA and RNA in oncology research to support personalized cancer treatments at Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève (HUG). After deploying a more advanced HPC cluster, I oversaw the smooth retirement and recycling of the old system, ensuring continued research operations.

Beyond the technical scope, my responsibilities included recruiting and training personnel, distributing tasks within the team based on individual strengths, and fostering a high-performing, collaborative environment. This role allowed me to significantly enhance SIB's infrastructure while supporting vital biomedical research.

I am eager to bring my leadership and technical expertise to new challenges focused on infrastructure optimization and team management.
